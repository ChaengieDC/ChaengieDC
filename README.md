Hello there !! I'm Chaengie !!    

🐱 As a baby dev, I started learning pretty recently and I've been loving it so far.  
🖱️ As of now, I mainly use basic languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Node.js.  
📒 For the future, I'm planning on learning C#, PHP, and Symfony.  
⏰ I'm currently working on my first project: [Collect SEKAI](https://github.com/ChaengieDC/Collect-SEKAI).
