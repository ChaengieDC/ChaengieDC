Hello there !! I'm Chaengie !!  
I'm a baby dev from France.    

🖱️ As of now, I mainly use basic languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Node.js.  
📒 For the future, I'm planning on learning PHP, Symfony and C#.  
🎨 I love creating things !! I have many ideas running through my mind and hope I'll be able to make them all come true one day !!    

⏰ I'm currently working on my first project: [Collect SEKAI](https://github.com/ChaengieDC/Collect-SEKAI).
